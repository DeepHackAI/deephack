# DeepHack Framework Architecture

## System Overview

DeepHack is a comprehensive framework designed for AI security testing and protection, with a specific focus on Large Language Models (LLMs). The system implements a multi-layered architecture that combines offensive testing capabilities with robust defensive measures.

## Core Components

### 1. Framework Core (src/framework.py)
The central orchestrator of the DeepHack system, managing the interaction between different components and coordinating the security evaluation process.

### 2. Security Layers

#### 2.1 Threat Intelligence System
Location: `src/defense/threat_intelligence.py`

Provides real-time monitoring and analysis of potential security threats:
- Behavioral pattern analysis
- Risk scoring system
- Anomaly detection
- Threat indicator identification

Key Features:
- Pattern-based threat detection
- Real-time risk assessment
- Behavioral anomaly monitoring
- Sensitive data exposure prevention

#### 2.2 Model Defense System
Location: `src/defense/`

Implements multiple layers of defensive measures:
- Input filtering and sanitization
- Instruction-level defense mechanisms
- Content safety verification
- Model behavior analysis

#### 2.3 AI Firewall
Location: `src/firewall.py`

Provides the first line of defense:
- Request validation
- Input sanitization
- Access control
- Rate limiting

### 3. Evaluation System

#### 3.1 Multi-Model Evaluators
Location: `src/evaluator/`

Comprehensive evaluation modules:
- ChatGLM Evaluator
- Garak Evaluator
- MindGuard Integration
- Inspect Evaluator
- Deepseek Evaluator

Each evaluator implements specialized security metrics and vulnerability detection methods.

#### 3.2 Behavioral Analysis
Location: `src/agent/behavior_monitor.py`

Monitors and analyzes:
- Model response patterns
- Interaction anomalies
- Security compliance
- Performance metrics

### 4. Offensive Testing Components

#### 4.1 Red Team Testing
Location: `src/attack/`

Implements various attack vectors:
- Prompt injection techniques
- Jailbreak attempts
- Model manipulation strategies
- Boundary testing

#### 4.2 Security Assessment Tools
Location: `src/evaluator/`

Provides tools for:
- Vulnerability scanning
- Penetration testing
- Security metric evaluation
- Risk assessment

## Data Flow

1. Input Processing
   ```
   User Input → AI Firewall → Threat Intelligence → Model Defense
   ```

2. Security Evaluation
   ```
   Model Defense → Evaluators → Behavior Analysis → Risk Assessment
   ```

3. Response Generation
   ```
   Risk Assessment → Security Verification → Response Filtering → User
   ```

## Security Mechanisms

### 1. Prevention
- Input validation and sanitization
- Pattern-based threat detection
- Behavioral anomaly monitoring
- Access control enforcement

### 2. Detection
- Real-time threat monitoring
- Behavioral analysis
- Anomaly detection
- Security metric evaluation

### 3. Response
- Automated threat mitigation
- Incident logging and reporting
- Security alert generation
- Response filtering

## Integration Points

### 1. External Systems
- LLamaGuard Integration
- Agent Smith Defense System
- Semantic Analysis System
- Multiple Model Evaluators

### 2. Plugins and Extensions
Location: `src/plugins/`

- Modular plugin architecture
- Custom security rule implementation
- Extended functionality support
- Third-party integration capabilities

## Deployment Architecture

### 1. Component Distribution
- Modular component design
- Scalable evaluation system
- Distributed security measures
- Centralized management

### 2. Security Layers
- Multiple defense layers
- Redundant security checks
- Layered threat detection
- Comprehensive protection

## Best Practices

### 1. Implementation
- Follow security-first approach
- Implement defense in depth
- Maintain modularity
- Regular security updates

### 2. Configuration
- Secure default settings
- Environment-specific configurations
- Regular security audits
- Performance optimization

## Conclusion

The DeepHack framework implements a comprehensive security architecture that combines offensive testing capabilities with robust defensive measures. The modular design allows for easy extension and customization while maintaining strong security controls throughout the system.
